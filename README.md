## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
    cd repo-name
    ```

2. **Navigate through the solutions**

    You can dive into each category and review the solutions for each problem. Each solution contains its description, approach, and often, the time and space complexity analysis.

## ðŸ“š Structure

The repository is divided into three primary categories:

-   **Data Structures**: Implementations and problems related to common data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and more.

-   **Algorithms**: Solutions to classic problems and various algorithmic challenges.

-   **Logic Puzzles**: Riddles and logic puzzles that require creative thinking to solve.

## ðŸ“– Resources

Here are some resources that I've been using for practice and learning:

-   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
-   [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
-   [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
